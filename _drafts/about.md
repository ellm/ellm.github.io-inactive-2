## Uses

I was inspired by Wes Bos to document the things I use as a web developer so I created my own version. This is a living document of things that I use day-to-day in my practice of web development.

- I use mostly Apple products. My main computer is a 13 MacBook Pro connected to Dell Monitor. I use Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard and Anchor Vertical mouse.
- I also own a MacBook Air for personal use
- For mobile, I have and iPhone 7 and iPad Mini
- I have a bamboo Upstanding Desk that allows me to sit and stand while working
- I have an Amazon Echo that I use to listen to WNYC radio, Podcasts and stream music from Pandora.
- I have an old HermonMiller chair that I use when I'm tired of standing

### Software

- I use Atom for day to day coding. I permanently switched in November 2016 from using Sublime Text for about 5 years. You can read my reasoning behind switching to Atom here.
- I use the GTD approach for productivity. Things allows me to prioritize my personal and work tasks and clear out my head. This is where I start my day.
- I use Apple Notes, Calendar and Reminders for my other productivity needs
- Google Chrome is my main browser for web development  and use Safari and Firefox for browser testing.
- Slack is open at all times and is used to communicate with my coworkers.
- Dash is used for for quickly looking up web documentation. I also use it for snippets.
- I use oh-my-zsh for my commandline.
- My dotfiles can be found here. Which includes many of the configurations I use for my development software  

### Web Technologies

- I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Php. I enjoy working on the front end mostly
- I used Java in school and hated it

### Practice and Routine

- I'm at the gym three days a week and using Running or doing cardio.
- Early mornings I use for learning. Right now, I'm learning ES6
- I get my Industry new mostly from these sources. For other news, I'm keen on NPR and public radio. My local station is WNYC
- I try to practice deep reading each day for at least 15-20 minutes each day
- My philosophy for day to day learning is to learn something, write it down and share it. Even if it is something small. I use the The Feynman Technique.
- I like to keep my toolchain very short. I'm a minimalist to say the least.
