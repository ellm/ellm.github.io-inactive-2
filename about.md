### Practice and Routine

- I go running three days a week. This is how get motivated and find clarity.
- Early mornings I use for learning. Right now, I'm learning ES6 and ReactJS.
- I get my Industry new mostly from these [sources](/notes/industry-news). For other news, I pay attention to NYT and public radio. My local station is [WNYC](http://wnyc.org).
- I try to practice deep reading each day for at least 15-20 minutes.
- My philosophy for day to day learning is to write it down and share it. Even if it is something small. I use [The Feynman Technique](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11981353).
