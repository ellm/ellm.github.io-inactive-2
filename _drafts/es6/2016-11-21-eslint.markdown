## Configuration:

- ESLint will use the `.eslintrc` file at project level.
- If it does not exist, it will then search the rest of your directory tree.
- it's common to have two config files, one at project level and another in home directory `~/`. The home directory version is good for performing "light linting".

## Line and File Settings:

`/*globals twttr ga */` avoid global error
`/* eslint-disable no-extend-native */` disable a specific rule (file or single line)
`eslint-disable` ..{code}.. `eslint-enable` disable linting on a block of code

-
## Command Line

Automatically fixes smaller lint errors on JS files.
`eslint file.js --fix` (single file)
`eslint /path/to/files/*.js --fix` (files in a folder)

## Plugins

- added to extend ESLinting. Linting in HTML and Markdown files
