## Configuration:

- ESLint will use the `.eslintrc` file at project level.
- If it does not exist, it will then search the rest of your directory tree.
- it's common to have two config files, one at project level and another in home directory `~/`. The home directory version is good for performing "light linting".

Example `.eslintrc` file:

``` json
{
  "env": {
    "es6": true,
    "browser": true
  },
  "extends": "airbnb",
  "rules": {
    "no-console": 0,
    "no-unused-vars": 1
  }
}
```

## Line and File Settings:

- `/*globals twttr ga */` avoid global error
- `/* eslint-disable no-extend-native */` disable a specific rule (file or single line)
- `eslint-disable` ..{code}.. `eslint-enable` disable linting on a block of code

## Command Line

Automatically fixes smaller lint errors on JS files.
- `eslint file.js --fix` (single file)
- `eslint /path/to/files/*.js --fix` (files in a folder)

## Plugins

- added to extend ESLinting. Linting in HTML and Markdown files

## SublimeText Linting

- linting in realtime can be helpful for instant feedback on your code quality.
- I've found it valuable to have a global install of ESLint and set my code editor to lint using a config file in my home directory i.e. `~/.eslintrc`.
- The home directory version is good for performing "light linting" such as rules for single quotes vs double quotes and spaces vs tabs.

### Configuration
- Install ESlint globally `npm install eslint -g`
- Install `SublimeLinter` and then `SublimeLinter-contrib-eslint`
- In `SublimeLinter.sublime-settings` use the following settings:

``` json
{
    "user": {

        "linters": {
            "eslint": {
                "@disable": false,
                // args allow you to pass ESlint CLI commands
                "args": [
                    "--config",
                    "/Users/matt/.eslintrc" // absolute path to a specific eslintrc file
                ],
                "excludes": [
                    "**/node_modules/**"
                ]
            },
        },

        "paths": {
            "linux": [],
            "osx": [
                "/usr/local/bin"
            ],
            "windows": []
        },
    }
}   
```
