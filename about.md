### Gear

- I use mostly Apple products. My main computer is a 13.3" MacBook Pro connected to a 24" Dell Monitor
- I also own an old MacBook Air for personal use
- For mobile, I have and iPhone 7 and iPad Mini
- I use [Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard](http://a.co/9sjwGmV) and [Anker Vertical mouse](http://a.co/1Yajje6).
- I have a bamboo [Uplift Desk](http://www.upliftdesk.com/) that allows me to sit and stand while working
- I have an Amazon Echo that I use to listen to [WNYC](http://www.wnyc.org/) radio, Podcasts and stream music.
- I have an old Hermon Miller chair that I use when I'm tired from standing

### Software

- I use [Atom](https://atom.io) for coding
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) allows me to prioritize my personal and work tasks and clear out my head. This is where I start my day.
- I use Apple Notes, Calendar and Reminders for my other productivity needs
- Google Chrome is my main browser for web development
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) is open at all times and is used to communicate with my coworkers.
- [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) is used for for quickly looking up web documentation.
- I use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/) for my command line.
- My [dotfiles](https://github.com/ellm/dotfiles) include many of the configurations I use for my development software

### Practice and Routine

- I'm at the gym three days a week running or doing cardio
- Early mornings I use for learning. Right now, I'm learning ES6
- I get my Industry new mostly from these sources. For other news, I'm keen on NYT, NPR and public radio. My local station is [WNYC](http://wnyc.org)
- I try to practice deep reading each day for at least 15-20 minutes
- My philosophy for day to day learning is to learn something, write it down and share it. Even if it is something small. I use [The Feynman Technique](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11981353).
- I like to keep my toolchain very short. I'm a minimalist to say the least.
