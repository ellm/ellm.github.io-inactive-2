About 3 weeks ago, I made the decision to try out Vim as my primary text editor.
It was frustrating at first, but I had done my research and witnessed the power
of what Vim can do in skilled hands. I was determined to get through that
barrier to entry that many people speak of. I am happy to say that today, I'm
feeling much more comfortable using Vim and I've made a lot of progress
transitioning from Sublime Text. I am far from a power user, but am convinced
that Vim is the right editor for me. Before I get into the details of my transition
to Vim, I'd like to explain why I decided to switch from Sublime Text.

Sublime is a great text editor. I've used it for 5+ years and have always
felt productive using it. One thing I could not get past in examining
my workflow was switching from Sublime Text to the terminal. I was doing it
constantly and the context switching was becoming an annoyance. There was also an
evolving change in my workflow that required a lot more work in the terminal
with tools such as Git and webpack. I thought, "Wouldn't it be great if I could
have two tools open during development, a terminal and my web browser?". This
was the initial question I had asked myself that eventually brought me to my
descision. However, it was not the only thing I considered before making the
switch to Vim, after all, I have invested more than 5 years learning Sublime
Text. These were the other things I considered that lead me to my descision.

1. *Keybindings* - I like that I can actually  be more productive with just a keyboard.
   This embraces a philosophy that I feel strongly about - "do more with less".

2. *Longevity* - Vim has been around for a long time, since the late 70's. It's
   not going anywhere anytime soon. This makes me feel confident that my investment
   in learning Vim will not go to waste.

3. *Open Source* - Vim is an open source project. It has years of development
   and community building behind it.

4. *Portability* - Vim can run on a wide-range of platforms. My settings can be
   easily loaded up on a new system.

So here I am, no longer using Sublime each day. Now, I fire up my web browser and
iTerm and I am ready to dig into code. However, my first day using Vim as my
primary editor felt unproductive. In fact, that feeling spanned around a few days. I leaned
heavily on Google when I could not figure something out and a few times opened
Sublime to do some heavier editing. I also spent a lot of time watching videos
on YouTube and reading tutorials online ranging from using the editor to
configuring your `.vimrc`. I put together a
[Vim YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3EgysXB6pALr3tKXxN2h--bvi2Ub7zY5)
that I felt had some useful tips. I'm also in the process of putting together
my own cheatsheet with commands to help build muscle memory which I will share
here when it is complete.

I do have a few lessons learned for someone who may be considering making the
switch to Vim.

1. First, think about why Vim (or any text editor) works well for your own workflow.
   You need to build reason behind making your switch and prepare to commit. I spent alot
   of time changing text editors and IDEs without truly considering my workflow.

2. Don't try to pick up everything at once. You will get overwelmed. I heard
   about NeoVim, MacVim, using tmux with Vim, Vim GUI, and it created a lot of
   noise. Focus on learning the basics. A great way to start is using `vimtutor`

3. Don't copy things into your `.vimrc` that you don't fully understand. It is
   better to build your own personal settings over time. I read that many Vim
   users have made tweaks to their configurations everyday for several years.

4. Enjoy the journey. I feel that Vim is an editor that you gotta stick with for
   the long term. It will start to payoff after you have put in the time.

## Plugins

- This is where I go through a few chosen essential plugins for Vim

- This is where I will go into setting I've made to `.vimrc` that made the
  transition to Sublime Text a bit easier.

- This is where I go into a short tutorial on using Vim. It will be a embedded
  gist from Github which will be used for a learnstuff.
