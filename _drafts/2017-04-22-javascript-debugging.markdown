“If an error is possible, someone will make it. The designer must assume that all possible errors will occur and design so as to minimize the chance of the error in the firs t place, or its effects once it gets made.Errors should be easy to detect, they should have minimal consequences, and, if possible, their effects should be reversible.”

- Donald A.Norman, The Design of Everyday Things


Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

- Brian Kernighan and P.J. Plauger, The Elements of Programming Style
